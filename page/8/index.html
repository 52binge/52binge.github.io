<p>Functional Programming 其思想更接近数学计算。</p>
<p>在计算机的层次上，CPU执行的是加减乘除的指令代码，以及各种条件判断和跳转指令，所以，汇编语言是最贴近计算机的语言。</p>
<p>而计算则指数学意义上的计算，越是抽象的计算，离计算机硬件越远。</p>
<p>对应到编程语言，就是越低级的语言，越贴近计算机，抽象程度低，执行效率高，比如C语言；越高级的语言，越贴近计算，抽象程度高，执行效率低，比如Lisp语言。</p>
<p>函数式编程就是一种抽象程度很高的编程范式，<code>纯粹的函数式编程语言编写的函数没有变量</code>，因此，任意一个函数，只要输入是确定的，输出就是确定的，这种纯函数我们称之为没有副作用。而允许使用变量的程序设计语言，由于函数内部的变量状态不确定，同样的输入，可能得到不同的输出，因此，这种函数是有副作用的。</p>
<p>函数式编程的一个特点就是，允许把函数本身作为参数传入另一个函数，还允许返回一个函数！</p>
<p>Python对函数式编程提供部分支持。由于Python允许使用变量，因此，Python不是纯函数式编程语言。</p>

<p>Jenny,</p>
<p>I’m visiting a friend in New Orleans. It’s a beautiful city. I love the buildings and the people. I’m having a good time, but a thief broke into my friend’s apartment and stole $130! That’s a lot of money. We called the police, and they are looking for the thief. I’m going home to Springdale tomorrow, and that’s OK with me. I’m really upset about the theft.</p>

<h2 id="1-Building-a-Spam-Classifier"><a href="#1-Building-a-Spam-Classifier" class="headerlink" title="1. Building a Spam Classifier"></a>1. Building a Spam Classifier</h2><h3 id="1-1-prioritize-what-to-work-on"><a href="#1-1-prioritize-what-to-work-on" class="headerlink" title="1.1 prioritize what to work on"></a>1.1 prioritize what to work on</h3><p>System Design Example:</p>
<p>Given a data set of emails, we could construct a vector for each email. Each entry in this vector represents a word. The vector normally contains 10,000 to 50,000 entries gathered by finding the most frequently used words in our data set. If a word is to be found in the email, we would assign its respective entry a 1, else if it is not found, that entry would be a 0. Once we have all our x vectors ready, we train our algorithm and finally, we could use it to classify if an email is a spam or not.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-02-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So how could you spend your time to improve the accuracy of this classifier?</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect lots of data (for example “honeypot” project but doesn’t always work)</li>
<li>Develop sophisticated features (for example: using email header data in spam emails)</li>
<li>Develop algorithms to process your input in different ways (recognizing misspellings in spam).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to tell which of the options will be most helpful.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-error-analysis"><a href="#1-2-error-analysis" class="headerlink" title="1.2 error analysis"></a>1.2 error analysis</h3><p>The recommended approach to solving machine learning problems is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a simple algorithm, implement it quickly, and test it early on your cross validation data.</li>
<li>Plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features, etc. are likely to help.</li>
<li>Manually examine the errors on examples in the cross validation set and try to spot a trend where most of the errors were made.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, assume that we have 500 emails and our algorithm misclassifies a 100 of them. We could manually analyze the 100 emails and categorize them based on what type of emails they are. We could then try to come up with new cues and features that would help us classify these 100 emails correctly. Hence, if most of our misclassified emails are those which try to steal passwords, then we could find some features that are particular to those emails and add them to our model. We could also see how classifying each word according to its root changes our error rate:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-02-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is very important to get error results as a single, numerical value. Otherwise it is difficult to assess your algorithm’s performance. For example if we use stemming, which is the process of treating the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word (fail), and get a 3% error rate instead of 5%, then we should definitely add it to our model. However, if we try to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters and end up getting a 3.2% error rate instead of 3%, then we should avoid using this new feature. Hence, we should try new things, get a numerical value for our error rate, and based on our result decide whether we want to keep the new feature or not.</p>

<p>So for the problem of skewed classes precision recall gives us more direct insight into how the learning algorithm is doing and this is often a much better way to evaluate our learning algorithms</p>

<p><strong>Good afternoon faculty, students, parents and friends.</strong></p>
<p>I am truly honored and grateful to speak at the commencement for the University of Maryland, Class of 2017. </p>
<p>People often ask me: Why did you come to the University of Maryland?<br>I always answer: Fresh air.</p>
<p>Five years ago, as I step off the plane from China, and left the terminal at Dallas Airport. I was ready to put on one of my five face masks, but when I took my first breath of American air. I put my mask away. </p>
<p>The air was so sweet and fresh, and utterly luxurious.</p>
<p>I was surprised by this. I grew up in a city in China, where I had to wear a face mask every time I went outside, otherwise, I might get sick.</p>
<p>However, the moment Iinhaled and exhaled outside the airport，I felt free.</p>
<p>No more fog on my glasses, no more difficult breathing, no more suppression.</p>
<p>Every breath was a delight. As I stand here today, I cannot help, but recall that feeling of freedom. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the University of Maryland, I will soon feel another kind of fresh air for which I will beforever grateful — the fresh air of free speech.</p>
<p>Before I came to the UnitedStates, I learned in history class about the Declaration of Independence, butthese words had no meaning to me— Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>I was merely memorizing the words to get good grades.</p>
<p>These words sounded so strange, so abstract and foreign to me, until I came to University of Maryland.</p>
<p>I have learned the right to freely express oneself is sacred in American.</p>
<p>Each day in Maryland, I was encouraged to express my opinions on controversial issues. </p>
<p>I could challenge astatement made by my instructor. I could even rate my professors online.</p>
<p>But nothing prepared me forthe culture shock I experienced when I watched a university production of the play— Twilight: Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Twilight is a play by AnnaDeavere Smith about the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.</p>
<p>The riots followed acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King.</p>
<p>For six days, the city was in chaos as citizens took to the streets.</p>
<p>In Twilight, the student actors were openly talking about racism, sexism and politics.</p>
<p>I was shocked, I never thought such topic could be discussed openly.</p>
<p>The play was my first taste of political story telling, one that makes the audience think critically. </p>
<p>I have always had a burning desire to tell these kinds of stories, but I was convinced that only authorities on the narrative, only authorities could define the truth. </p>
<p>However, the opportunity toimmerse myself in the perse community at the University of Maryland exposed me to various, many different perspectives on truth.</p>
<p>I soon realized that here I have the opportunity to speak freely. </p>
<p>My voice matters. </p>
<p>Your voice matters.</p>
<p>Our voices matter.</p>
<p>Civil engagement is not at ask just for politicians. I have witnessed this when I saw my fellow student smarching in Washington DC, voting in the presidential election and raising money to support various causes.</p>
<p>I have seen that everyone has a right to participate and advocate for change.</p>
<p>I used to believe that one inpidual participation could not make a difference, but here we are, United Terps.</p>
<p>Together, we can push our society to be more just, open and peaceful.</p>
<p>Class of 2017, we are graduating from a university that embraces a liberal arts education that nurtures us to think critically, and also to care and feel for humanity. </p>
<p>We are equipped with the knowledge of various disciplines and we are ready to face  the challenges of our society.</p>
<p>Some of us may go to graduate school, some us may step into professions and some of us may begin ajourney of exploration.</p>
<p>But no matter what we do,remember, democracy and free speech should not be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Democracy and freedom are the fresh air that is worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Freedom is oxygen. Freedomis passion. Freedom is love.</p>
<p>And as a French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said: freedom is a choice, our future is dependent on the choices we make today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are all playwrights of the next chapters of our lives. Together, we write the human history.</p>
<p>My friends, enjoy the fresh air and never ever let it go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="1-Evaluating-a-Hypothesis"><a href="#1-Evaluating-a-Hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="1. Evaluating a Hypothesis"></a>1. Evaluating a Hypothesis</h2><p>Once we have done some <strong>trouble shooting</strong> for errors in our predictions by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more training examples</li>
<li>Trying smaller sets of features</li>
<li>Trying additional features</li>
<li>Trying polynomial features</li>
<li>Increasing or decreasing $λ$</li>
</ul>
<p>We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.</p>
<p>A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a training set and a test set. Typically, the training set consists of 70% of your data and the test set is the remaining 30%.</p>
<p>The new procedure using these two sets is then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn $\Theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\Theta)$ using the training set</li>
<li>Compute the test set error $J_{test}(\Theta)$</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The test set error</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For linear regression: $J_{test}(\Theta) = \dfrac{1}{2m_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}}(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}_{test}) - y^{(i)}_{test})^2$</li>
<li>For classification ~ Misclassification error (aka 0/1 misclassification error):</li>
</ol>
<p>$$<br>err(h_\Theta(x),y) = \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } h_\Theta(x) \geq 0.5\ and\ y = 0\ or\ h_\Theta(x) &lt; 0.5\ and\ y = 1\newline 0 &amp; \mbox otherwise \end{matrix}<br>$$</p>
<p>This gives us a binary 0 or 1 error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:</p>
<p>$$<br>\text{Test Error} = \dfrac{1}{m_{test}} \sum^{m_{test}}_{i=1} err(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}_{test}), y^{(i)}_{test})<br>$$</p>
<p>This gives us the proportion of the test data that was misclassified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>inaccurate[ɪn’ækjərət]、procedure [prə’sidʒɚ] 比例<br>remaining [ri’men..]、 Misclassification [‘mis,klæsifi’keiʃən]<br>validation [,vælə’deʃən] 确认，批准</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-Model-Selection"><a href="#2-Model-Selection" class="headerlink" title="2. Model Selection"></a>2. Model Selection</h2><p><strong>Train/Validtion/Test Sets</strong></p>
<p>Just because a learning algorithm fits a training set well, that does not mean it is a good hypothesis. It could over fit and as a result your predictions on the test set would be poor. The error of your hypothesis as measured on the data set with which you trained the parameters will be lower than the error on any other data set.</p>
<p>Given many models with different polynomial degrees, we can use a systematic approach to identify the ‘best’ function. In order to choose the model of your hypothesis, you can test each degree of polynomial and look at the error result.</p>
<p>One way to break down our dataset into the three sets is:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"> Training set: 60%</font></li>
<li><font color="blue"> Cross validation set: 20%</font></li>
<li><font color="blue"> Test set: 20%</font>

</li>
</ul>
<p>We can now calculate three separate error values for the three different sets using the following method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimize the parameters in Θ using the training set for each polynomial degree.</li>
<li>Find the polynomial degree d with the least error using the cross validation set.</li>
<li>Estimate the generalization error using the test set with $J_{test}(\Theta^{(d)})$, (d = theta from polynomial with lower error);</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This way, the degree of the polynomial d has not been trained using the test set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance"><a href="#3-Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance" class="headerlink" title="3. Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance"></a>3. Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance</h2><p>In this section we examine the relationship between the degree of the polynomial d and the underfitting or overfitting of our hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to distinguish whether <code>bias</code> or <code>variance</code> is the problem contributing to bad predictions.</li>
<li>High bias is underfitting and high variance is overfitting. Ideally, we need to find a golden mean between these two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The training error will tend to <code>decrease</code> as we increase the degree d of the polynomial.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cross validation error will tend to decrease as we increase d up to a point, and then it will increase as d is increased, forming a convex curve.</p>
<p><strong>High bias (underfitting)</strong>: both $J_{train}(\Theta)$ and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ will be high. Also, $J_{CV}(\Theta) \approx J_{train}(\Theta)$.</p>
<p><strong>High variance (overfitting)</strong>: $J_{train}(\Theta)$ will be low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ will be much greater than $J_{train}(\Theta)$.</p>
<p>The is summarized in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-01-01.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="4-Regularization-Bias-Variance"><a href="#4-Regularization-Bias-Variance" class="headerlink" title="4. Regularization Bias/Variance"></a>4. Regularization Bias/Variance</h2><p>Note: [The regularization term below and through out the video should be $\frac \lambda {2m} \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j ^2$ and NOT $\frac \lambda {2m} \sum_{j=1}^m \theta_j ^2$]</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-01-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the figure above, we see that as λ increases, our fit becomes more rigid. On the other hand, as λ approaches 0, we tend to over overfit the data. So how do we choose our parameter λ to get it ‘just right’ ? In order to choose the model and the regularization term λ, we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of lambdas (i.e. λ∈{0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.16,0.32,0.64,1.28,2.56,5.12,10.24});</li>
<li>Create a set of models with different degrees or any other variants.</li>
<li>Iterate through the λs and for each λ go through all the models to learn some Θ.</li>
<li>Compute the cross validation error using the learned Θ (computed with λ) on the $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ <strong>without</strong> regularization or λ = 0. <code>？？</code></li>
<li>Select the best combo that produces the lowest error on the cross validation set.</li>
<li>Using the best combo Θ and λ, apply it on $J_{test}(\Theta)$ to see if it has a good generalization of the problem.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5-Learning-Curves"><a href="#5-Learning-Curves" class="headerlink" title="5. Learning Curves"></a>5. Learning Curves</h2><p>Training an algorithm on a very few number of data points (such as 1, 2 or 3) will easily have 0 errors because we can always find a quadratic curve that touches exactly those number of points. Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the training set gets larger, the error for a quadratic function increases.</li>
<li>The error value will plateau out after a certain m, or training set size.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experiencing high bias:</strong></p>
<p>Low training set size: causes $J_{train}(\Theta)$ to be low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ to be high.</p>
<p>Large training set size: causes both $J_{train}(\Theta)$ and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$  to be high with $J_{train}(\Theta)$≈$J_{CV}(\Theta)$.</p>
<p>If a learning algorithm is suffering from high bias, getting more training data will not (by itself) help much.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-01-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>me : 随着train sets的增加，高偏差会降低，因为更容易找到合适的 Hypothesis 去拟合数据。所以CV error下降。</p>
<p><strong>Experiencing high variance:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low training set size:</strong> $J_{train}(\Theta)$ will be low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ will be high.</p>
<p><strong>Large training set size:</strong> $J_{train}(\Theta)$ increases with training set size and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ continues to decrease without leveling off. Also, $J_{train}(\Theta)$ &lt; $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ but the difference between them remains significant.</p>
<p>If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, getting more training data is likely to help.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ml/ml-ng-w6-01-04.png" alt=""></p>
<p>me : 随着 train sets 的增加，overfiting 越来越不容易。造成 CV error 下降。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plateau out / leveling off 达到平稳状态<br><code>test error will be CV error on picture.</code></p>
